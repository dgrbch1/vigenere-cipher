# vigenere-cipher
Math Project

## Overview
This project is about the **Vigen√®re cipher**, a classic encryption algorithm. It takes a word (key) and uses it to encrypt and decrypt text. I wrote a Python program that:

- Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext.

- Decrypts ciphertext back into plaintext.

- Lets you test how the cipher works.
